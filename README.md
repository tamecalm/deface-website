# Website Defacement Simulation Project

This project demonstrates a simulated website defacement for testing purposes. It showcases how your website might look if hacked and is intended to help developers visualize vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. The project includes glitchy, animated elements with a "hacked" theme, along with a Matrix-style background effect.

## Features
- **Glitch Effect:** Glitchy "HACKED" text animation on the main page.
- **Matrix Animation:** A background animation inspired by the Matrix movie, featuring falling emojis and text to simulate a "hacked" effect.
- **Interactive Button:** A panic button that simulates user interaction with an alert message.
- **Canvas Animation:** A canvas-based JavaScript effect for a cool, dynamic display.

## Setup

### Running Locally with Node.js

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/deface-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd deface-project
    ```

3. **Install Node.js (if not installed)**:
    ```bash
    pkg install nodejs
    ```

4. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

5. **Open the project** in your browser by navigating to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ```

### Running Locally with Python

Alternatively, you can use Python to serve the project:

1. **Install Python (if not installed)**:
    ```bash
    pkg install python
    ```

2. **Run the HTTP server**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    ```

3. **Open the project** in your browser by navigating to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    ```

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** The structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** Styling, including glitchy effects and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Logic for animations, interaction, and Matrix-style effects.
- **Node.js (Optional):** For running a simple HTTP server to serve the webpage.
- **Python (Optional):** Another option to run a simple HTTP server.
